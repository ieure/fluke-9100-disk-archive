DTC: KryoFlux DiskTool Console, v2.62_OSX_x86-64, uiv.1, May 29 2016, 00:18:27
Dump: 01/OB

Notes:
These disksets shipped with two copies of UUT_TEST_DISK-V1.0. They're
identical; only one dump is archived here.

The system disks are only usable with mainframes with site code
001. The site code of 9100 mainframes may be altered with a service
disk.

The system disks show some modified sectors. I believe they are
unused, and there may have been an update applied to the
mass-duplicated media. I was able to boot them on hardware which could
not have possibly had the same serial number, and received no
warnings; therefore, I have marked them OG.
