Notes:

This disk appears to be remanufactured, and is in unknown condition.
The Programmer System Disk label is applied over a label for a
different disk, and every sector has been rewritten.

The back side has a handwritten "S/N 4285001," implying that it was
installed on that machine and modified as a result.  The specifics of
the modification are impossible to recover due to the reuse of media.
