Notes:
This diskset is taken from a kit produced by Fluke for the United
States Air Force in the fall of 1990.  The kit contained 2x1MB SIMMs
to upgrade the RAM of a 9100A, four floppy disks, and documentation.
All the documentation and software is archived here.

The paper documentation appears to have been printed with a consumer
or commercial printer (laser or inkjet), rather than being
professionally typeset.  A large amount of damage is present from ink
transferring to adjacent pages.  The documents are still readable,
however, the damage makes OCR impractical at this time.
