Dump: 02/MG

Notes:

This is a near-complete set of the V6.0 Fluke software, missing only
the Demo/Trainer User Disk.  Compared tothe 01/MG diskset, this one
has original, unmodified Master User Disks, Programmer System Disk,
and IEEE-488 Feature Disk.  The three system disks have been modified,
like the 01/MG dump.

The last version of Demo/Trainer User Disk was V4.0, and may be
sourced from the 9100-PROGRAMMERS_DISK_SET-V6.1__01-OG diskset.
