DTC: KryoFlux DiskTool Console, v2.62_OSX_x86-64, uiv.1, May 29 2016, 00:18:27
Dump: 01/OG

Notes:
Verified good, unserialized, un-site-coded, unmodified factory media.

Master User Disk 2 has one marginal sector, at cylinder 79, head 0,
sector 6, which SamDisk warns about a CRC error on.  The Kryoflux
DiskTool Console does not exhibit this issue, and produces a slightly
different disk image.  This sector is unallocated and the slight
difference in SamDisk's output will not affect the usability of the
resulting disk.  However, if you want a perfect dupliate, you will
need to write it with a Kryoflux.
