Fluke 9100 Floppy Archive
=========================

This is an attempt to create a comprehensive archive of factory media
for the Fluke 9100 series of microsystem troubleshooters.

Organization
============

Individual disks are organized into disksets, which represent a
logical collection of disks.  Both disks and disksets are identified
with a descriptive name, version, disk number, dump number, and dump
status.

Descriptive Names
-----------------

These are usually the text printed on the disk label.

Version
-------

The version of the data contained on the disk.

Disk Number
-----------

When data is split across multiple disks, the number is indicated as
D1, D2, etc.  Optional if the disk is self-contained.

Dump Number
-----------

Dump numbers start at 01 and increment by one for each dump of a
distinct physical disk.  For example, if there are two copies of the
9100A-68000-POD_USER_DISK-V1.0 disk, the first dump would be assigned
01, and the second 02.  Re-dumping the same physical disk is not
encouraged, but a dump of a second factory copy containing the same
data may be desirable if the first media is damaged.

Dump Status
-----------

This consists of two letters, represeting the media and dump status.

O - Original, unmodified media.
M - Modified media.

G - Good dump, all sectors read successfully.
B - Bad dump, some sectors unreadable.

The status of a diskset is the same as the worst of each status of
every disk in the set.  If a diskset contains all original disks, with
one bad dump, the diskset's status is OB.  A diskset can't have a
status of OG unless every disk is original and dumped successfully.

Examples
--------

 ` Description of the data


Directory Structure
-------------------

The top level of the archive contains directories representing
disksets; underneath that is another directory for the disk(s) in the
set.

Each diskset directory contains a CATALOG file with additional
information about the dump, photos of -FRONT and -BACK photos of the
disks archived, an INDEX file with the contents of the disk, and a ZIP
archive of the KryoFlux STREAM.

Writing Media
=============

Disks are preserved in the Kryoflux STREAM format, which allows
perfect copies to be created.  Because these are archival images for
specialized hardware, they're larger than a typical disk image, and
cannot be used directly without Kryoflux hardware.  However, SAMDisk
supports KryoFlux STREAM images, and can be used to write the images
to disks, or to convert to a more convenient format.

To write an image to disk with SAMDisk:

SAMDISK COPY MASTER_USER_DISK-D1-V4.1,01-OG.img00.0.raw A:

To write an image to disk with Kryoflux's DTC:

dtc -fMASTER_USER_DISK-D1-V4.1,01-OG.img00.0.raw -w

To convert to ImageDisk format:

SAMDISK COPY MASTER_USER_DISK-D1-V4.1,01-OG.img00.0.raw MUD1.IMD

The original media is double-density 3.5" floppy disks, and it's
recommended that you write them to the same type of media.  If you use
high-density media, you *must* degauss it first, using a bulk magnetic
eraser or similar electromagnetic device.  Formatting in a
high-density drive is not sufficient.  Failure to degauss high-density
media will likely result in read failures, as the larger
double-density disk head may pick up stray magnetic fields from the
adjacent high-density tracks.
