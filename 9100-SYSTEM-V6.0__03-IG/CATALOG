Notes:

An original, unmodified factory System V6.0 diskset.  This set lacks
the Programmer System Disk and Demo/Trainer User Disk.  Based on the
"9105" written on the labels, these were intended for a system without
the video card, monitor, or keyboard to support the programmer option.

Combining these images with the 9100-SYSTEM-V6.0__02-IG and
9100-PROGRAMMERS_DISK_SET-V6.1__01-OG yields a complete V6.0 diskset.
