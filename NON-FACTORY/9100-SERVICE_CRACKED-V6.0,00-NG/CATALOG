Notes:
This is an image of a disk which was used on a mainframe; that process
wrote the mainframe's serial number back to the disk.  A TeleDisk
image was made after it had been keyed to the mainframe.  That image
was modified to remove the serial number protection, written to a
disk, and reimaged.

This isn't archival quality, but is included for convenience until it
can be replaced with unmodified factory media.
