Notes:

This appears to be an attempt to create a test program for the Canon
A-200 EX II, an obscure PC/AT clone from the late 1980s.  The attempt
seems to have gone nowhere, since there's nothing related to the
machine other than the writing on the label, but, since the computer
was based on the 80286, whoever made it started by copying the 9132A
Master User Disk for the 80286 personality.
