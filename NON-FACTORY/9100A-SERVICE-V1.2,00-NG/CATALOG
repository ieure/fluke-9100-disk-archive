Notes:
This is a stream image of a disk which was written from a TeleDisk
image of original media.

This isn't archival quality, but is included for convenience until it
can be replaced with unmodified factory media.

The older version of the service disk appears to have more options for
the type of hard disk than 1.4 or 6.0. Presumably that support was
removed in later versions of the ROMs, so use caution if you run it on
an up-to-date machine.
