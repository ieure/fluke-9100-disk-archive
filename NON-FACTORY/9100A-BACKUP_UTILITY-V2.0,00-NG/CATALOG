Notes:
This is a stream image of a disk which was written from a TeleDisk
image of original media.

This isn't archival quality, but is included for convenience until it
can be replaced with unmodified factory media.

A copy of the manual for this software has been included.  While the
manual indicates that installing the utility keys the disk to the
serial number of the mainframe, this doesn't appear to be the case.
