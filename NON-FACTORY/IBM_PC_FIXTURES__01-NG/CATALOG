Notes:

User-created test disks for IBM PC/XT and/or PC/AT.  The disks labels
are inconsistent with their contents and reality.  The XT_286 disk
contains an XT_286 UUT, but the PC/XT used an 8mhz 8088, not a 286.
The XT_FIXTURE disk contains an AT_FIXTURE UUT, which appers to be a
fairly complete PC/AT troubleshooting suite, including responses and
GFI.  It's appears to derive from (or be heavily inspired by) the
Demo/Trainer User Disk.
