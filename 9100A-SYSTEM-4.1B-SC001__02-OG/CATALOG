Dump: 02/MG

Notes:
This is a dump of a second copy of this diskset.  Unlike the 01/OB
dump, all disks in this set were successfully read.

They have the same modifications for site code 001, on track 0 and 62.

Both the userdisks appear to be recycled from other disks at the
factory.  Every sector is modified, as if the media was created, then
reformatted and rewritten; and the version is written by hand on the
label, whereas dump 01 of this diskset has it printed.  I am flagging
these OG.
